    "My project focuses on the genetic aspect of allergic disease. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on allergic disease. A SNP is a single base pair mutation in an individual's genome. In the field of computational biology and bioinformatics, there are several association studies performed, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and exome-wide association studies (EXWAS), which aim to identify SNPs and genes associated with phenotypes of interest. After these studies are completed, the analysis of the associations is a critical step. In some cases, individuals identify cohorts for association studies and the analyze those results independently. However, in the current era of big data, there are repositories that store the results of many association studies and allows individuals to conduct large scale meta-analyses. One of these repositories is the GWAS Catalog."

    "I will analyze the trends among the SNPs associated with allergic disease. Within allergic disease, there are several distinct phenotypes. I want to identify the major differences between associations among different phenotypes. What role do the chromosomal and base pair location play? Do the number of genes near the SNP or specific genes impact the associations? Does the risk allele have any correlation with the phenotype? Is the strength of the SNP's association (p-value) linked to any of the other covariates (chromosome, base pair location, number of genes, risk allele)? How does the direction of effect (odds ratio) impact the strenth of the association? My initial plan is to focus on grouping the SNPs by phenotype and comparing the different groups. I also want to aggregate all the SNPs into a single allergy phenotype and then compare individual phenotypes with this entire grouping to identify any underlying differences between specific phenotypes and generic allergic disease. For example, do the SNPs associated with allergic rhinitis tend to have a positive direction of effect while general allergy associations have a negative direction of effect?"

    "Next, I compared the average values per trait. One interesting column is the odds ratio (OR) column. All traits have an oddfs ratio between 1-3, but mostly between 1-2. However, one trait has an odds ratio of ~7.5, indicating that its associated SNPs are \"extremely damaging\" (significantly larger than 1) and they cause individuals to have the trait. This table also suggests that chromosome may impact the associations (even though the correlation values suggested the degree of assocation - pvalue). The average chromosome should be somewhere between 11-13, but there are only 4 traits in this range."
